# Cheese

## Motivation
Motivation behind the name - Cheese, the more it ages the more sophisticated(delicious) the taste. That's the idea this project is built on. A simple working page that increases in flavor as you add more content.

Initial thoughts were to create a simple blogging website with CRUD capabilities. Once CRUD was achieved I wanted to add more features to make the page a more usable working space.
