# Cheese
<br />

## Synopsis
Welcome to Cheese. A working personal space where you can read your favourite news while planning for the day or blogging out your thoughts. 

## How it works
* On the main page you will be prompted to sign in - if you don't already have login details simply sign up.
* Once signed in navigate to the different tabs to check out the different features.

## Motivation
Motivation behind the name - Cheese, the more it ages the more sophisticated(delicious) the taste. That's the idea this project is built on. A simple working page that increases in flavour as you add more content. 

Initial thoughts were to create a simple blogging website with CRUD capabilities. Once CRUD was achieved I wanted to add more features to make the page a more usable working space.

* Angular.js 1.6
* Knex.js
* PostgresSQL
* Jquery

* Node.js
* Express.js
